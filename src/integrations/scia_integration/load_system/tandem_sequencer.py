    """
    Calculate the longitudinal x-positions of tandem systems along the bridge deck.

    The tandem systems are positioned starting from an offset based on the bridge deck thickness
    (accounting for load spread), and distributed at intervals along the deck length.
    For improved accuracy near supports (where shear forces are critical), the function uses
    fine spacing (0.5 * spacing) for 3 positions on each side of every support, while middle
    positions use the standard spacing. The function ensures that mid-span positions for each
    span are always included (critical for maximum bending moment analysis).

    The starting offset is calculated as TANDEM_START_Y_OFFSET_FACTOR * thickness_bridgedeck,
    then adjusted by the vehicle length.

    Args:
        length_bridgedeck (float): The total length of the bridge deck in meters.
        thickness_bridgedeck (float): The thickness of the bridge deck in meters, used to calculate
            the starting offset based on load spread assumption (45-degree angle).
        length_vehicle (float): The length of the vehicle in meters. Defaults to 0.0.
        spacing (float): The longitudinal spacing between consecutive tandem systems in meters.
            Defaults to TANDEM_SPACING_LONGITUDINAL (1.0 meters).
        support_x_coords (list[float] | None): X-coordinates of all support locations from bridge geometry.
            If None, defaults to supports at start (X=0) and end (X=length_bridgedeck) only.
            If provided, fine spacing is applied around all supports including intermediate ones.

    Returns:
        list[float]: A sorted list of unique x-positions (in meters) where tandem systems should be
            placed along the bridge deck, with fine spacing near supports and mid-span positions.
